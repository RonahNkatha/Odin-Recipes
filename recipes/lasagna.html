  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna ingredients are easily available and it's one of the most easiest meal to make with minimal time</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> 1/2 lb. ground beef
    <li>
    <li>lb. hot breakfast sausage
    <li>
    <li>cloves garlic, minced
    <li>
    <li>(14.5-oz.) cans whole tomatoes
    <li>
    <li> (6-oz.) cans tomato paste
    <li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. dried parsley, divided
    <li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. dried basil
    <li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li <li>low-fat cottage cheese<li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten
    <li>
    <li>1/2 c. grated (not shredded) parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. olive oil
    <li>
    <li>1 (1o-oz.) package lasagna noodles
    <li>
    <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese
    <li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat
      until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons
      parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes
      while you are working on the other steps.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more
      teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then
      cook the lasagna noodles until al dente (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
    <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon
      half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella
      cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture.
      Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
    <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to 2 days, or bake immediately: 350°F oven until the top is hot and bubbly, 20
      to 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
